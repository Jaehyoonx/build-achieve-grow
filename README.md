## Description
The **B.A.G.** is a full-stack **Express + React** web application that visualizes the performance of major **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)** from multiple industries, including **Technology, Finance, Energy, and Healthcare**.  

Users can explore and compare trends across industries, view live or historical performance data, and access summaries and insights for each ETF.  
As developers, our goal is to provide a clean, fast, and interactive interface that helps users understand how different sectors are performing in global markets.

All core data is processed on the **Express server** and stored in **MongoDB**, while the **React client** handles visualization, filtering, and dynamic interactions.
